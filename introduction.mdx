### What is this  
This is a website that aims to document short-lived hosting services, more specifically the ones created by Matt James.

### What are they  
These are hosting services that only last a few weeks or months. Most of the time, the services are free and use a currency system earned by AFKing (keeping a page open in your browser to gain coins per minute).
