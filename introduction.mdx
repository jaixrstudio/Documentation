# Introduction

This website is made to explain and expose what “summerhosts” really are. If you've ever used a free hosting service that suddenly disappeared or felt kind of sketchy, you might’ve seen one without knowing.

## What Is a Summerhost?

A summerhost is a hosting service that usually lasts only a short time — maybe a few weeks or a couple of months. Most of them are free, but they come with problems.

They often:

- Have no proper Terms of Service or Privacy Policy  
- Use servers they got in unfair or illegal ways  
- Are run by people with little experience  
- Disappear suddenly without warning

## Why We Made This Site

We created this site to help others stay safe and informed. Our goal is to:

- Show which hosts are unsafe or fake  
- Share real evidence, not rumors  
- Help people avoid wasting time on bad hosts

This isn't about causing drama. We just want to tell the truth and help others make smart choices.
