### What is this  

This website is dedicated to documenting short-lived hosting services, more specifically the ones created by Matt James and others in the same scene.  

These services are an unusual part of internet history â€” popping up suddenly, running for only a short time, and then vanishing without much trace.

### What are they  

The term started around 2018 and usually refers to free or cheap hosting services with little to no legal policies.  

They often ran on misused servers, were poorly managed, and usually shut down after only a few weeks or months.  

A well-known figure in this trend is **Ether**, who created many short-lived hosts that quickly gained attention before disappearing.
